# foobar
__You know, foo-ing the bar.__

Earlier in 2018 I stumbled across Google's renown foobar challenges. This repository is me stumbling through them!! Hopefully I will finish them all someday, but that day is not today. 

Think HackerRank, CodeWars, Code Kata.. All of those types of problems. Very CS.

In this repository you will find two directories. One containing all of the challenges I have completed so far, and one containing test cases for every challenge.
